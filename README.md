# About Project
## Energy_Load_Prediction_and_Classification
Predicted Energy load of residential buildings based on its features with an accuracy of 90.91%.Performed EDA and feature scaling. 
Built and tested ridge, Lasso , SVM kernel, tree models and found them to be overfitting. Built a 5-layer sequential neural network
with relu and sigmoid activation functions to predict andclassify energy load with high accuracy
